# BaxterDualManipulatorBlockAssembly
 Thesis repository: ROS environment for Baxter dual arm block assembly

To Run: This repository will have to be compiled in a new ROS environment using catkin_make
also the directory path on line 413 will have to be changed using new environments path
(this line is in assembly_movement/scripts/movement_node.py)

This repository only contains the source and some shell code, no development and build.
